This has been challenging to find time and prioritize a personal blog and portifolio but the time has come!

The motivation behind this is to speak out about the challenges of the software development industries, focused on Frontend development.
Over the past 10 years of my career I've worked for 6+ software companies and 8+ digital products. I've developed simple features, such as static websites and landing pages, more complex systems such as a messenger gateway that would centralize messages and chats from multiple channels. I've worked on B2B products and B2C products. I've tried my hand in Product management and System architecture. All that to say that in this multitude of contexts, one thing remained clear: Frontend development is hardly taken seriously. Not only by other fields, but even by other fellow frontend developers.

Now here I am, to speak up about design patterns, code design, architecture and how all that applies to the frontend.

If you are interested in all this, stay tuned :)

All the best -- Sam
